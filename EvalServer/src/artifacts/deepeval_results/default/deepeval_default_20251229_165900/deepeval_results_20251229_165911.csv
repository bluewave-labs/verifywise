code_001,coding,easy,68,434,"The function should take a single argument, which is the number to be calculated. The function should return the result of the factorial calculation. The function should be implemented using recursion, with a base case where the factorial of 0 and 1 is returned. The function should also handle negative numbers and non-integer inputs. The function should be named `factorial` and should have a docstring explaining its functionality.","A recursive Python function that calculates factorial, with a base case checking if n is 0 or 1, and a recursive case that returns n * factorial(n-1).",,False,,False,,False
code_002,coding,medium,0,0,,"Binary search works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It compares the middle element with the target value. If equal, return the position. If target is smaller, search the left half; if larger, search the right half. Time complexity is O(log n) because the search space halves with each iteration.",,False,,False,,False
code_003,coding,easy,76,424,"The class should have a max capacity and a size attribute. The push method should add an element to the top of the stack, while the pop method should remove and return the top element. The peek method should return the top element without removing it. The class should also have a method to display the contents of the stack in reverse order. The implementation should be written in Python and follow PEP 8 style guidelines.","A Stack class with an internal list. push(item) appends to the list, pop() removes and returns the last item (with empty check), peek() returns the last item without removing it. The class follows LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.",,False,,False,,False
