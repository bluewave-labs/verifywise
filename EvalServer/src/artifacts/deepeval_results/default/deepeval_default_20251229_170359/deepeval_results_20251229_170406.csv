code_001,coding,easy,70,444,The function should take a single argument `n` representing the number to be factored. The function should return the factorial of `n` as an integer. The function should handle inputs that are non-integer values. The function should also handle negative numbers with a meaningful error message. The function should be well-documented and follow PEP 8 style guidelines. Test the function with various input values to ensure it works as expected.,"A recursive Python function that calculates factorial, with a base case checking if n is 0 or 1, and a recursive case that returns n * factorial(n-1).",,False,,False,,False
