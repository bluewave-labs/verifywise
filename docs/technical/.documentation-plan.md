## Execution Order

1. ~~Structure (README)~~ ✓
2. Architecture docs (gives context for everything else)
3. Infrastructure docs (cross-cutting services)
4. Frontend docs
5. API reference
6. Domain docs (largest section)
7. Guides (need to understand system first)

## Template for Each Document

Each document should follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Title]

## Overview
Brief description of what this covers

## [Relevant sections based on document type]

## Key Files
List of relevant source files with paths

## Related Documentation
Links to related docs
```

## Notes for Future Sessions

- Start by reading this plan file
- Check off completed items as you go
- Run `git status` to see what's been created
- The README.md at `/docs/technical/README.md` is the entry point
