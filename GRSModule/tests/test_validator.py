"""
Unit tests for the GRS validation stage minimum-validity rule.

Each parametrized case checks three things:
  1. expected_valid  — whether validate_candidates() accepts the scenario
  2. must_have_dims  — DIMENSION_PATTERNS keys that must match the prompt
  3. must_have_signals — SIGNAL_PATTERNS keys that must match the prompt
     (note: 'action_request' is not part of the _has_signal_gate minimum rule,
      but its presence in must_have_signals still asserts the pattern matches)
