The server's state will be identical whether you execute the request 1 time or 100 times.\n\n## Key Concept\n\nIdempotency is about the **final state**, not the response. Multiple identical requests should leave the server in the same state, even if the response might differ.\n\n## Idempotent HTTP Methods\n\n### ✅ GET\n- **Idempotent**: Yes\n- Reading data multiple times doesn't change anything\n```http\nGET /users/123\nGET /users/123  # Same result, no state change\n```\n\n### ✅ PUT\n- **Idempotent**: Yes\n- Updating to the same value multiple times = same final state\n```http\nPUT /users/123\n{ \"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30 }\n\n# Calling again produces same result\nPUT /users/123\n{ \"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30 }  # User still has same values\n```\n\n### ✅ DELETE\n- **Idempotent**: Yes\n- Deleting the same resource multiple times = resource is still deleted\n```http\nDELETE /users/123  # User deleted\nDELETE /users/123  # User still deleted (might return 404, but state unchanged)\n```\n\n### ❌ POST\n- **NOT Idempotent**\n- Creates new resources each time\n```http\nPOST /users\n{ \"name\": \"John\" }  # Creates user with ID 1\n\nPOST /users\n{ \"name\": \"John\" }  # Creates ANOTHER user with ID 2\n```\n\n### ✅ PATCH\n- **Usually NOT idempotent** (depends on implementation)\n- Can be idempotent if designed carefully\n\n## Why It Matters\n\n1. **Retry Safety**: Safe to automatically retry idempotent requests if they fail\n2. **Network Reliability**: Handle timeouts/duplicates without side effects\n3. **Caching**: Idempotent methods can be cached more safely\n4. **API Design**: Helps clients understand expected behavior",
