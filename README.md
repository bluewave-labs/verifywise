## Installation

The VerifyWise application has two components: a frontend built with React.js and a backend built with Node.js. At present, you can use `npm` (for development) or Docker/Kubernetes (production) to run VerifyWise. A PostgreSQL database is required.

### Installation using npm (for development)

Prerequisites:

- npm and Docker
- A running PostgreSQL, preferably as a Docker image (eg. using `docker pull postgres:latest`)
- Available ports: 5173 (frontend), 8080 (backend), 5432 (database)

#### Step 1: Clone, install dependencies, and set up databases

First, clone the repository to your local machine and go to verifywise directory. Then, navigate to the Clients directory and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/bluewave-labs/verifywise.git
cd verifywise
cd Clients
npm install
cd ../Servers
npm install
```

Go to the root directory and copy the contents of .env.dev to the .env file. For security, you must set a strong and unpredictable JWT_SECRET in your .env file. This secret is used to sign and verify your JWT tokens, so it must be kept private and cryptographically secure. You can generate a 256-bit base64-encoded secret using `openssl rand -base64 32`.

```
cd ..
cp .env.dev Servers/.env
```

In `.env` file, change FRONTEND_URL:

```
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

Note: CORS is automatically configured to allow requests from the same host (localhost, 127.0.0.1) where the backend is running.

Run the PostgreSQL container with the following command:

```
docker run -d --name mypostgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD={env variable password} postgres
```

Run redis with following command:

```
docker run -d --name myredis -p 6379:6379 redis
```

Access the PostgreSQL container and create the verifywise database:

```
docker exec -it mypostgres psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE verifywise;
```

#### Step 2: Set up EvalServer (for LLM evaluations)

EvalServer is a Python-based service that handles LLM evaluations. If you want to use the evaluation features, follow these steps:

```
cd EvalServer
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up the environment file. You can copy the minimal `.env.example` file in the EvalServer directory:

```
cd ..
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Step 3: Start the application

Navigate to the EvalServer/src directory and start the server:

```
cd EvalServer/src
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```

Navigate to the Servers directory and start the server in watch mode:

```
cd Servers
npm run watch
```

Navigate to the Clients directory and start the client in development mode:

```
cd Clients
npm run dev
```

**Note:** Make sure to replace {env variable password} with the actual password from your environment variables.

**Note:** Since no users exist by default, you'll see the admin registration page first. Register your admin account here. After registration, you'll be redirected to login, and will be able to use your new credentials.

### Installation using Docker (production)

First, ensure you have the following installed:

- npm
- Docker
- Docker Compose

Create a directory in your desired folder:

```
mkdir verifywise
cd verifywise
```

Download the required files using wget:

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluewave-labs/verifywise/develop/install.sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluewave-labs/verifywise/develop/.env.prod
```

Make sure to change the JWT_SECRET variable to your liking, and change `localhost` to the IP of the server. An example is shown below:

```
BACKEND_URL=http://64.23.242.4:3000
FRONTEND_URL=http://64.23.242.4:8080
```

Note: CORS is automatically configured to allow requests from the same host where the backend is running.

Change the permissions of the `install.sh` script to make it executable, and then execute it.

```
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```

Now the server is running on the IP and the port you defined in .env.prod file (8080 by default).

If the install.sh script doesn't work for some reason, try the following commands:

```
docker-compose --env-file .env.prod up -d backend
docker ps  # to confirm
docker-compose --env-file .env.prod up -d frontend
docker ps  # to confirm
```

If you want to re-run install.sh for some reason (e.g want to change a configuration in .env.prod file), first stop all Docker containers before starting a new one:

```
docker-compose --env-file .env.prod down
./install.sh
```

**Note:** Since no users exist by default, you'll see the admin registration page first. Register your admin account here. After registration, you'll be redirected to login, and will be able to use your new credentials.

### Installing SSL

Here are the steps to enable SSL on your system.

1. Make sure to point domain to VM IP

2. Install Nginx:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

3. Create a config file (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/verifywise`) with the following content. Change the domain name accordingly.

```
server {
    server_name domainname.com;

    client_max_body_size 200M;

    # Custom error page for maintenance/upgrades
    error_page 502 503 504 /upgrade.html;

    location = /upgrade.html {
        root /var/www/verifywise;
        internal;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
 }
```

4. Create the directory for custom error pages and copy the upgrade page:

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/verifywise
sudo curl -o /var/www/verifywise/upgrade.html https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluewave-labs/verifywise/develop/Clients/upgrade.html
```

5. Enable the config:

```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/verifywise /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

6. Install Certbot for SSL:

```
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
```

7. Obtain SSL certificate. Change the domain name accordingly.

```
sudo certbot --nginx -d domainname.com
```

8. Update the `.env.prod` to point to correct domain. Change the domain name accordingly.

```
BACKEND_URL=https://domainname.com/api
FRONTEND_URL=https://domainname.com
```

Note: CORS is automatically configured to allow requests from the same host where the backend is running.

9. Restart the application

```
./install.sh
```

**Note:** The Nginx configuration includes custom error pages that display a professional "upgrading" message instead of the default "502 Bad Gateway" error when the servers are not running or during maintenance.

### Email configuration

VerifyWise supports multiple email service providers through a provider abstraction layer, enabling administrators to choose the most suitable email service for their organization. The system includes security enhancements such as TLS enforcement, input validation and credential rotation for supported providers.

Below is a list of supported email providers. You can use [this documentation](https://docs.verifywise.ai/settings#email-services) to setup the email service of your choice.

- **Exchange Online (Office 365)** - Microsoft's cloud email service
- **On-Premises Exchange** - Self-hosted Exchange servers
- **Amazon SES** - AWS Simple Email Service
- **Resend** - Developer-focused email API
- **Generic SMTP** - SMTP support for any provider

### Ports

You’ll need to open ports 80 and 443 so VerifyWise can be accessed from the internet.

## Security
