code_001,coding,easy,48,308,"Your function should take a single argument, which is the number to be calculated. The function should return the factorial of the number. Your function should be well-documented and follow PEP 8 style guidelines. Ensure that your code is properly commented and follows best practices for Python programming.","A recursive Python function that calculates factorial, with a base case checking if n is 0 or 1, and a recursive case that returns n * factorial(n-1).",1.0,True,0,True,0,True
code_002,coding,medium,0,0,,"Binary search works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It compares the middle element with the target value. If equal, return the position. If target is smaller, search the left half; if larger, search the right half. Time complexity is O(log n) because the search space halves with each iteration.",1.0,True,0,True,0,True
code_003,coding,easy,77,402,"The class should have a maximum capacity of 10 elements, and each element should be able to be added to the top of the stack. The class should also have a method to check if the stack is empty. The stack should be implemented using a stack data structure (i.e., a list or tuple) and using a function call to add elements to the top of the stack. Make sure to include unit tests to verify functionality.","A Stack class with an internal list. push(item) appends to the list, pop() removes and returns the last item (with empty check), peek() returns the last item without removing it. The class follows LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.",1.0,True,0,True,0,True
