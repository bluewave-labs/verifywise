math_001,Unknown,Unknown,250,False,"Step 1: Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to get:

x + 5 = 12 / 5 = 2.4

Step 2: Multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to get:

2.4 x = 12 * 5 = 72

Step 3: Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation to get:

2.4 x - 12 = 72 - 12 = 50

Step 4: Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to get:

50 / 5 = 10

Step 5: Multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to get:

10 x = 72 * 5 = 420

Step 6: Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation to get:

420 - 10 = 310

Step 7: Multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to get:

310 x = 1200

Step 8: Solve for x:

x = (1200 ÷ 310) / 5 = 33.333333

Step 9: Check if the solution is valid:

x is not a valid solution because it is less than or equal to 12.

Step 10: Rewrite the equation:

x = 33.333333

Step 11: Solve for x:

x = (1200 ÷ 33.333333) / 5 = 30.666667

Step 12: Check if the solution is valid:

x is a valid solution because it is greater than or equal to 30.

Solution:

x = 30.666667

Explanation:

To find the value of x for the given equation, we first solved for x using the method described in the previous step. The value of x is:

x = 30.666",x = 7 (by subtracting 5 from both sides),0.267,False,0,True,0,True
math_002,Unknown,Unknown,176,False,"A: The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the squares of the lengths of the sides are equal. The theorem is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who first formulated it.
The theorem can be written as follows:
Square of a side = Square of the opposite side + Square of the adjacent side

where S is the length of the side.

Example:

Let's consider a right triangle with sides a, b, and c.

a = 4
b = 5
c = 3

The theorem states that:

Square of a = Square of the opposite side + Square of the adjacent side

Square of opposite side = 4^2 + 5^2 = 192
Square of adjacent side = 5^2 + 3^2 = 144

Therefore,

Square of the opposite side = 192
Square of the adjacent side = 144

So, the lengths of the sides are:

a = 4
b = 5
c = 3

A, b, and c are all equal, and the length of a side is 4.

This is the Pythagorean theorem.","The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (c) equals the sum of squares of the other two sides: a² + b² = c². Example: If sides are 3 and 4, then 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25, so the hypotenuse is √25 = 5.",0.75,True,0,True,0,True
