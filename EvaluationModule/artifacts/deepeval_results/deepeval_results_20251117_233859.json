    "actual_output": "# JavaScript Debouncing Example for Resize Event\n\nHere's a complete example showing how to debounce a resize event:\n\n## Basic Implementation\n\n```javascript\n// Debounce function\nfunction debounce(func, delay) {\n  let timeoutId;\n  \n  return function(...args) {\n    // Clear the previous timeout\n    clearTimeout(timeoutId);\n    \n    // Set a new timeout\n    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {\n      func.apply(this, args);\n    }, delay);\n  };\n}\n\n// Your resize handler function\nfunction handleResize() {\n  console.log('Window resized!');\n  console.log('Width:', window.innerWidth);\n  console.log('Height:', window.innerHeight);\n}\n\n// Create debounced version (waits 300ms after last resize)\nconst debouncedResize = debounce(handleResize, 300);\n\n// Add event listener\nwindow.addEventListener('resize', debouncedResize);\n```\n\n## More Advanced Example with Immediate Execution Option\n\n```javascript\nfunction debounce(func, delay, immediate = false) {\n  let timeoutId;\n  \n  return function(...args) {\n    const callNow = immediate && !timeoutId;\n    \n    clearTimeout(timeoutId);\n    \n    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {\n      timeoutId = null;\n      if (!immediate) {\n        func.apply(this, args);\n      }\n    }, delay);\n    \n    if (callNow) {\n      func.apply(this, args);\n    }\n  };\n}\n\n// Execute immediately on first call, then debounce\nconst debouncedResize = debounce(handleResize, 300, true);\nwindow.addEventListener('resize', debouncedResize);\n```\n\n## Practical Use Case - Updating Layout\n\n```javascript\nconst debounce = (func, delay) => {\n  let timeoutId;\n  return (...args) => {\n    clearTimeout(timeoutId);\n    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => func(...args), delay);\n  };\n};\n\n// Update layout based on window size\nfunction updateLayout() {\n  const width = window.innerWidth;\n  const container = document.querySelector('.container');\n  \n  if (width < 768) {\n    container.classList.add('mobile');\n    container.classList.remove('desktop');\n  } else {\n    container.classList.add('desktop');\n    container.classList.remove('mobile');\n  }\n}\n\n// Debounce with 250ms delay\nwindow.addEventListener('resize', debounce(updateLayout, 250));\n\n// Call once on page load\nupdateLayout();\n```\n\n## Using Lodash (if available)\n\n```javascript\n// If you're using Lodash library\nimport { debounce } from 'lodash';\n\nconst handleResize = () => {\n  console.log('Resized:', window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);\n};\n\nwindow.addEventListener('resize', debounce(handleResize, 300));\n```\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n- **Performance**: Reduces the number of times the function executes\n- **Efficiency**: Prevents excessive DOM manipulations or calculations\n- **Smooth UX**: Avoids janky behavior during rapid events\n\nThe debounce waits until the user stops resizing for the specified delay before executing the function, rather than executing it repeatedly during the resize.",

    "actual_output": "# Idempotent HTTP Methods\n\n## Definition\n\n**Idempotent** means that making the same request multiple times produces the same result as making it once. The server's state will be identical whether you call the method 1 time or 100 times.\n\n## Key Point\n\nIdempotency is about the **server state**, not the response. Multiple identical requests should leave the server in the same state, even if the response might differ.\n\n## HTTP Methods by Idempotency\n\n### Idempotent Methods ✓\n\n- **GET** - Reading data multiple times doesn't change it\n- **PUT** - Updating to the same value multiple times = same result\n- **DELETE** - Deleting something already deleted = still deleted\n- **HEAD** - Like GET, just retrieves headers\n- **OPTIONS** - Querying options doesn't change state\n\n### Non-Idempotent Methods ✗\n\n- **POST** - Each request typically creates a new resource\n\n## Examples\n\n### PUT (Idempotent)\n```http\nPUT /users/123\n{ \"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30 }\n```\nCalling this 5 times → User 123 still has name=\"John\", age=30\n\n### DELETE (Idempotent)\n```http\nDELETE /users/123\n```\n- First call: User deleted (200 OK)\n- Second call: User already gone (404 Not Found)\n- **Result**: User is deleted either way ✓\n\n### POST (Non-Idempotent)\n```http\nPOST /orders\n{ \"item\": \"book\", \"quantity\": 1 }\n```\nCalling this 5 times → 5 different orders created ✗\n\n## Why It Matters\n\n- **Retry safety**: Clients can safely retry idempotent requests if they timeout\n- **Network reliability**: Handles duplicate requests from network issues\n- **API design**: Helps decide which HTTP method to use",
