# Approval Workflow & Real-time Notification System

## Overview

This feature implements a complete approval workflow system with real-time notifications for use-case approvals. When a use-case is created with an assigned approval workflow, it goes through multiple approval steps before frameworks are created.

## Key Features

- **Multi-step approval workflows**: Configure workflows with multiple sequential approval steps
- **Flexible approver requirements**: Steps can require all approvers or just one approver to proceed
- **Real-time notifications**: Approvers are notified instantly via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Deferred framework creation**: Frameworks are only created after full approval
- **Multi-tenant safe**: Complete isolation between organizations
- **Transaction-safe notifications**: Notifications sent only after database commits
- **Multi-server support**: Redis Pub/Sub ensures notifications work across multiple server instances

## Quick Start Example

### Create a Workflow

```bash
POST /api/approval-workflows
{
  "workflow_title": "Use Case Approval",
  "entity": 1,
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_number": 1,
      "step_name": "Marketing Review",
      "requires_all_approvers": false,
      "approvers": [2, 3]
    },
    {
      "step_number": 2,
      "step_name": "Finance Approval",
      "requires_all_approvers": true,
      "approvers": [4]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Create Use-Case with Workflow

```bash
POST /api/projects
{
  "project_title": "Q1 Campaign",
  "approval_workflow_id": 5,
  "framework": [1, 2],
  ...
}
```

### Approve a Request

```bash
POST /api/approval-requests/14/approve
{
  "comments": "Approved!"
}
```

## Recent Changes

### 2026-01-09
- **Fixed notification timing bug**: Moved notification calls to after transaction commits
- **Fixed project visibility**: Editors and Auditors can now view all projects
- **Added real-time count updates**: Approval request count auto-refreshes on notifications
- **Improved alert consistency**: Notifications now use standard alert styling
- **Improved transaction handling**: Updated all READ queries to use proper optional transaction pattern (`transaction: Transaction | null = null` with conditional spread)
- **Removed debug logging**: Cleaned up all console.log statements from frontend and backend for production-ready code
