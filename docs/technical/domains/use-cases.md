# Use Cases Domain

## Overview

A **Use Case** (internally called a **Project**) represents a discrete AI system or application that requires compliance assessment against governance frameworks. Each use case is uniquely identified by a `UC-ID` (e.g., "UC-1", "UC-2") and serves as the container for risks, vendors, models, and framework-specific compliance controls.

## Key Concepts

### What is a Use Case?

A Use Case in VerifyWise represents:
- An AI system requiring compliance assessment
- A container for risks, vendors, and models
- The primary entity for framework compliance tracking
- A collaborative workspace with stakeholder assignments

### Use Case ID (UC-ID)

Each use case receives a unique identifier generated from a database sequence:
- Format: `UC-{number}` (e.g., "UC-1", "UC-2", "UC-15")
- Auto-generated on creation
- Tenant-specific sequence
- Cannot be modified after creation

## Database Schema

### Projects Table

```

├── start_date
├── geography
├── ai_risk_classification   # PROHIBITED, HIGH_RISK, LIMITED_RISK, MINIMAL_RISK
├── type_of_high_risk_role   # DEPLOYER, PROVIDER, DISTRIBUTOR, etc.
├── goal
├── target_industry
├── description
├── last_updated
├── last_updated_by (FK → users)
├── is_demo                  # Demo/test project flag

├── approval_workflow_id (FK → approval_workflows)
├── pending_frameworks       # JSONB array, awaiting approval
└── enable_ai_data_insertion
```

### AI Risk Classification

```typescript
enum AiRiskClassification {
  PROHIBITED = "Prohibited"
  HIGH_RISK = "High risk"
  LIMITED_RISK = "Limited risk"
  MINIMAL_RISK = "Minimal risk"
}
```

### High Risk Role Types

```typescript
enum HighRiskRole {
  DEPLOYER = "Deployer"
  PROVIDER = "Provider"
  DISTRIBUTOR = "Distributor"
  IMPORTER = "Importer"
  PRODUCT_MANUFACTURER = "Product manufacturer"
  AUTHORIZED_REPRESENTATIVE = "Authorized representative"
}
```

### Project Status

```typescript
enum ProjectStatus {
  NOT_STARTED = "Not started"
  IN_PROGRESS = "In progress"
  UNDER_REVIEW = "Under review"
  COMPLETED = "Completed"
  CLOSED = "Closed"
  ON_HOLD = "On hold"
  REJECTED = "Rejected"
}
```

## Related Tables

### Projects Members

Many-to-many relationship between users and projects.

```
projects_members
├── user_id (PK, FK → users)
├── project_id (PK, FK → projects)
└── is_demo
```

### Projects Frameworks

Links projects to compliance frameworks.

```
projects_frameworks
├── framework_id (PK, FK → frameworks)
├── project_id (PK, FK → projects)
└── is_demo
```

Supported frameworks:
1. EU AI Act (framework_id: 1)
2. ISO 42001 (framework_id: 2)
3. ISO 27001 (framework_id: 3)
4. NIST AI RMF (framework_id: 4)

## Status Workflow

```
NOT_STARTED → IN_PROGRESS → UNDER_REVIEW → COMPLETED → CLOSED
                                  ↓
                          REJECTED / ON_HOLD → IN_PROGRESS
```

### Status Transitions

| From | To | Trigger |
|------|-----|---------|
| NOT_STARTED | IN_PROGRESS | Work begins |
| IN_PROGRESS | UNDER_REVIEW | Assessment complete |
| UNDER_REVIEW | COMPLETED | Review approved |
| UNDER_REVIEW | REJECTED | Review failed |
| UNDER_REVIEW | ON_HOLD | Paused |
| ON_HOLD | IN_PROGRESS | Resumed |
| COMPLETED | CLOSED | Archived |

### Request

```typescript
POST /projects
{
  project_title: string,           // Required
  owner: number,                   // Required, user ID
  members: number[],               // Optional, user IDs
  framework: number[],             // Required, framework IDs
  start_date: Date,                // Required
  ai_risk_classification: string,  // Required
  type_of_high_risk_role: string,  // Required
  goal: string,                    // Required
  geography?: number,
  target_industry?: string,
  description?: string,
  is_organizational?: boolean,
  approval_workflow_id?: number,
  enable_ai_data_insertion?: boolean
}
```

### Processing

1. Generate unique `UC-ID` from sequence
2. Create project record
3. Assign members to project
4. **If no approval workflow:**
   - Create framework records immediately
   - Initialize framework-specific data
5. **If approval workflow set:**
   - Store frameworks in `pending_frameworks`
   - Create ApprovalRequest
   - Wait for approval before framework creation
6. Trigger `project_added` automation
7. Send email to project owner
8. Send Slack notification

### Response

```typescript
{
  project: ProjectModel,
  frameworks: { [key: string]: Object }
}
```

## Update Project

### Request

```typescript
PATCH /projects/:id
{
  project_title?: string,
  owner?: number,
  members?: number[],
  start_date?: Date,
  ai_risk_classification?: string,
  type_of_high_risk_role?: string,
  goal?: string,
  geography?: number,
  target_industry?: string,
  description?: string,
  status?: string
}
```

### Processing

1. Get current project state
2. Compare member lists (old vs new)
3. Add new members, remove deleted members
4. Notify newly added members via email
5. Record all changes in change history
6. Trigger `project_updated` automation

## Delete Project

### Cascading Deletions

When a project is deleted, the following are removed:

1. Withdraw pending approval requests
2. Record deletion in change history
3. Delete associated risks (`projects_risks`)
4. Delete members (`projects_members`)
5. Delete framework-specific data (controls, assessments)
6. Delete framework associations (`projects_frameworks`)
7. Delete associated files
8. Delete project record
9. Trigger `project_deleted` automation

## Stakeholder Management

### Project Owner

- Single user responsible for the project
- Has administrative access
- Receives project notifications
- Stored in `projects.owner` field

### Project Members

Stored in `projects_members` junction table.

**Member Types:**

| Type | Access | Permissions |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Demo | Read-only | `["read_only", "demo_access"]` |
| Regular | Full | `["full_access", "read_write"]` |

### Role-Based Notifications

When members are added, they receive role-specific emails:

```typescript
roleMap = {
  1: "admin",
  2: "reviewer",
  3: "editor",
  4: "auditor"
}
```
