{"id": "uc_001", "prompt": "Explain how photosynthesis works in plants.", "reference": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. It occurs in the chloroplasts, where chlorophyll absorbs light energy."}
{"id": "uc_002", "prompt": "What are the main causes of climate change?", "reference": "The main causes of climate change include burning fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial processes, and agriculture, all of which increase greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere."}
{"id": "uc_003", "prompt": "Describe the process of machine learning model training.", "reference": "Machine learning model training involves feeding data to an algorithm, which learns patterns through iterative optimization of parameters to minimize prediction errors."}
{"id": "uc_004", "prompt": "What is the capital of France and what is it known for?", "reference": "Paris is the capital of France. It is known for the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and its rich history in art, fashion, and cuisine."}
{"id": "uc_005", "prompt": "Explain the difference between HTTP and HTTPS.", "reference": "HTTP is the standard protocol for web communication, while HTTPS adds SSL/TLS encryption for secure data transmission, protecting against eavesdropping and tampering."}
{"id": "uc_006", "prompt": "What is the role of a database index and when should you use one?", "reference": "A database index is a data structure that improves query performance by allowing faster data retrieval. Use indexes on columns frequently used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and ORDER BY statements."}
{"id": "uc_007", "prompt": "Explain the concept of recursion in programming with an example.", "reference": "Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. For example, calculating factorial: factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1), with base case factorial(0) = 1."}
{"id": "uc_008", "prompt": "What are the benefits and drawbacks of microservices architecture?", "reference": "Benefits include scalability, independent deployment, and technology flexibility. Drawbacks include increased complexity, network latency, and challenges in data consistency across services."}
{"id": "uc_009", "prompt": "How does a blockchain ensure data integrity?", "reference": "Blockchain ensures data integrity through cryptographic hashing, where each block contains the hash of the previous block, creating an immutable chain. Any tampering would invalidate subsequent hashes."}
{"id": "uc_010", "prompt": "Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.", "reference": "Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models that predict outputs for new inputs. Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction."}
