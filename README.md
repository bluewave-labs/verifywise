## Developer Setup

The VerifyWise application has two components: a frontend in Reactjs and backend in Nodejs. At present, you can use Docker (recommended) or `npm` to run VerifyWise. 

A PostGreSQL database is required.

To run a development instance of VerifyWise via `npm`, follow these steps:

1. Fork and clone the repository. Go to the Clients directory.
2. Run `npm i; npm run dev`
3. Go to ../Servers directory.
4. Run `npm i; npm run watch`
5. Now the application is up and running on `https://localhost:5173` 

Currently the application is in rapid development, so check back here often.

## Who is it for?

The platform makes AI governance easier for organizations. It helps them manage risks, ensure they follow rules, and promote responsible AI practices throughout their operations.

VerifyWise is designed for:

- **Businesses**: From those considering AI adoption to organizations developing proprietary AI at scale.
- **Compliance officers**: Professionals ensuring compliance to EU AI Act regulations and internal policies.
- **Risk management teams**: Groups tasked with identifying and mitigating AI-related risks.
- **Legal and privacy teams**: Professionals addressing the legal and ethical implications of AI use.
- **AI developers**: Teams working on AI projects who need to ensure compliance and responsible development.

## Why now? 

- **There is an urgent need for regulatory compliance:** Regulations set clear rules for AI applications and create a need for organizations to comply with legal requirements.
- **Complexity of compliance:** Companies will need governance tools that can help them manage a changing regulatory landscape. 
- **Growing concerns for Ethical AI:** There’s a strong push from governments, businesses, and consumers for more ethical and transparent AI systems.
- **Good timing with global AI expansion:** Starting an open source AI governance app now aligns with the AI adoption trend across industries (healthcare, finance etc), leading the need for a quickly deployable governance solution.
