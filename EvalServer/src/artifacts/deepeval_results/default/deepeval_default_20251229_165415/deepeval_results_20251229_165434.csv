code_001,coding,easy,125,792,"The function should take the number as an argument and return the result. The function should be implemented with a recursive structure. The function should be named `factorial()` and it should have a signature that accepts a single integer argument. The function should return a value representing the factorial of the input number. The function should handle both positive and negative numbers. The implementation should use a base case where the input number is 0. The function should also handle edge cases such as 0 and negative numbers. The function should be well-documented with clear and concise comments. Ensure that the code is well-organized, well-commented, and follows PEP 8 style guidelines. Test your function with various inputs and ensure that it returns the expected value.","A recursive Python function that calculates factorial, with a base case checking if n is 0 or 1, and a recursive case that returns n * factorial(n-1).",,False,,False,,False
code_002,coding,medium,0,0,,"Binary search works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It compares the middle element with the target value. If equal, return the position. If target is smaller, search the left half; if larger, search the right half. Time complexity is O(log n) because the search space halves with each iteration.",,False,,False,,False
code_003,coding,easy,53,280,"The class should have a method to check if the stack is empty, and a method to display the stack. The stack should implement the Stack interface with a push method, a pop method, and a peek method. The class should also have a constructor that takes the maximum size of the stack.","A Stack class with an internal list. push(item) appends to the list, pop() removes and returns the last item (with empty check), peek() returns the last item without removing it. The class follows LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.",,False,,False,,False
