        answer: "The model testing strategy involves a thorough evaluation of the model using unseen data that simulates real-world scenarios, which helps to assess the generalization ability of the model. Unlike validation, which is done during the training phase to optimize hyperparameters, testing occurs post-training to evaluate the final performance. This strategy ensures that the model will work as expected when deployed in the production environment."

        answer: "The AI system will be served to end-users via a cloud-based API, enabling seamless access from multiple devices and platforms. To ensure accessibility, the system will comply with web accessibility standards (WCAG). For reliability, the architecture will include load balancing, failover mechanisms, and redundancy. Security measures include end-to-end encryption, regular security audits, and user authentication to prevent unauthorized access."

        answer: "To track the AI system’s performance in production, we will implement real-time monitoring using tools like Prometheus and Grafana. These systems will monitor key metrics such as response time, accuracy, and system resource utilization. Data gathered will be analyzed to detect performance degradation or issues, allowing us to proactively tune the model or retrain it with updated data to maintain optimal performance."

        answer: "Yes, we have selected AWS as the cloud provider and defined a secure deployment architecture that utilizes private virtual networks, secure APIs, and encrypted data storage. To address AI system security risks, we employ techniques like adversarial training to protect against adversarial attacks and regularly update security protocols to mitigate jailbreak vulnerabilities. We also monitor system integrity to detect and prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of the AI models."

        answer: "Our organization employs continuous data monitoring tools that track the quality of incoming data and compare it against expected patterns. We have set thresholds for data drift, such as a 10% shift in feature distributions, to trigger alerts for intervention. For model decay, we perform periodic evaluations of model performance against new data, and if accuracy drops by more than 5%, we initiate retraining with updated datasets to maintain model relevance and accuracy."
