    {
      "question": "How far back does the activity feed go?",
      "answer": "The activity feed stores up to 50 activities by default. You can adjust this in the plugin settings (10-200 range). Older activities are automatically removed when new ones are added."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I filter activities by type?",
      "answer": "Currently, the feed shows all activity types together. Filtering by entity type (projects, risks, tasks, vendors) is planned for a future update."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the activity feed persisted across server restarts?",
      "answer": "Yes, activities are stored in the database and will persist across server restarts. The plugin uses the metadata storage API to ensure data durability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who can see the activity feed?",
      "answer": "All users with access to the dashboard can see the activity feed. Activities show the user who performed each action when available."
