code_001,coding,easy,68,455,"Your function should take one argument, the number to calculate the factorial of. The function should return the factorial of the number. The function should be written using Python's built-in recursion feature, which allows you to define a recursive function by calling itself. Your function should be well-documented and follow Python's best practices for code structure and readability. Use descriptive variable names and comments to explain your code.","A recursive Python function that calculates factorial, with a base case checking if n is 0 or 1, and a recursive case that returns n * factorial(n-1).",,False,,False,,False

If equal, return the position. If target is smaller, search the left half; if larger, search the right half. Time complexity is O(log n) because the search space halves with each iteration.",,False,,False,,False
