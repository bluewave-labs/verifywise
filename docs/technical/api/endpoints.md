# API Endpoints

## Overview

VerifyWise exposes a REST API at `http://localhost:3000/api/`. All routes use JWT authentication via `authenticateJWT` middleware unless otherwise specified. The API is organized by domain with consistent patterns for CRUD operations.

## Authentication

### JWT Authentication

All protected routes require a valid JWT token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

Tokens are obtained via `/api/users/login` and refreshed via `/api/users/refresh-token`.

### Rate Limiting

| Endpoint | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Login | 5 req/min per IP |
| Password reset | 5 req/min per IP |
| Invite | 5 req/min per IP |
| AI Detection scans | 30 req/15 min |
| Webhook creation | 10 req/hour |
| Plugin installation | 20 req/hour per IP |
| File operations | Configured limit |

### Roles

| Role | ID | Description |
