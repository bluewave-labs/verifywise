[1] Sample code_001
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protected Attributes: {'category': 'coding', 'difficulty': 'easy'}
Input (truncated): Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion....

ACTUAL OUTPUT: The function should prompt the user to enter a positive integer, and return the factorial of the entered number. The function should handle invalid input (e.g., non-positive integer) and display an error message. The function should also be well-documented and follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
EXPECTED OUTPUT: A recursive Python function that calculates factorial, with a base case checking if n is 0 or 1, and a recursive case that returns n * factorial(n-1).
CORRECT: False

[2] Sample code_002
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protected Attributes: {'category': 'coding', 'difficulty': 'medium'}
Input (truncated): Explain how to implement a binary search algorithm in Python with time complexity analysis....

ACTUAL OUTPUT: 
EXPECTED OUTPUT: Binary search works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It compares the middle element with the target value. If equal, return the position. If target is smaller, search the left half; if larger, search the right half. Time complexity is O(log n) because the search space halves with each iteration.
CORRECT: False

[3] Sample code_003
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protected Attributes: {'category': 'coding', 'difficulty': 'easy'}
Input (truncated): Create a Python class for a stack data structure with push, pop, and peek methods....

ACTUAL OUTPUT: The class should have a maximum capacity of 10 elements and implement the Stack interface with the methods push, pop, and peek. The implementation should use a stack data structure and include error handling for empty stacks and overflow. The code should be well-commented and follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
EXPECTED OUTPUT: A Stack class with an internal list. push(item) appends to the list, pop() removes and returns the last item (with empty check), peek() returns the last item without removing it. The class follows LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.
CORRECT: False

[4] Sample math_001
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protected Attributes: {'category': 'mathematics', 'difficulty': 'easy'}
Input (truncated): Solve: If x + 5 = 12, what is x?...

ACTUAL OUTPUT: Step 1: Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to get:

x + 5 = 12 / 5 = 2.4

Step 2: Multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to get:

2.4 x = 12 * 5 = 72

Step 3: Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation to get:

2.4 x - 12 = 72 - 12 = 50

Step 4: Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to get:

50 / 5 = 10

Step 5: Multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to get:

10 x = 72 * 5 = 420

Step 6: Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation to get:

420 - 10 = 310

Step 7: Multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to get:

310 x = 1200

Step 8: Solve for x:

x = (1200 ÷ 310) / 5 = 33.333333

Step 9: Check if the solution is valid:

x is not a valid solution because it is less than or equal to 12.

Step 10: Rewrite the equation:

x = 33.333333

Step 11: Solve for x:

x = (1200 ÷ 33.333333) / 5 = 30.666667

Step 12: Check if the solution is valid:

x is a valid solution because it is greater than or equal to 30.

Solution:

x = 30.666667

Explanation:

To find the value of x for the given equation, we first solved for x using the method described in the previous step. The value of x is:

x = 30.666
EXPECTED OUTPUT: x = 7 (by subtracting 5 from both sides)
CORRECT: False

[5] Sample math_002
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protected Attributes: {'category': 'mathematics', 'difficulty': 'medium'}
Input (truncated): Explain the Pythagorean theorem and provide an example....

ACTUAL OUTPUT: A: The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the squares of the lengths of the sides are equal. The theorem is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who first formulated it.
The theorem can be written as follows:
Square of a side = Square of the opposite side + Square of the adjacent side

where S is the length of the side.

Example:

Let's consider a right triangle with sides a, b, and c.

a = 4
b = 5
c = 3

The theorem states that:

Square of a = Square of the opposite side + Square of the adjacent side

Square of opposite side = 4^2 + 5^2 = 192
Square of adjacent side = 5^2 + 3^2 = 144

Therefore,

Square of the opposite side = 192
Square of the adjacent side = 144

So, the lengths of the sides are:

a = 4
b = 5
c = 3

A, b, and c are all equal, and the length of a side is 4.

This is the Pythagorean theorem.
EXPECTED OUTPUT: The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (c) equals the sum of squares of the other two sides: a² + b² = c². Example: If sides are 3 and 4, then 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25, so the hypotenuse is √25 = 5.
CORRECT: False
