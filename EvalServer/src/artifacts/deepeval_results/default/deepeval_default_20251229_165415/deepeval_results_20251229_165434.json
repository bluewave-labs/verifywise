The function should be named `factorial()` and it should have a signature that accepts a single integer argument. The function should return a value representing the factorial of the input number. The function should handle both positive and negative numbers. The implementation should use a base case where the input number is 0. The function should also handle edge cases such as 0 and negative numbers. The function should be well-documented with clear and concise comments. Ensure that the code is well-organized, well-commented, and follows PEP 8 style guidelines. Test your function with various inputs and ensure that it returns the expected value.",
